Normal mode analysis is another option. In this\ncase mdrun builds a Hessian matrix from single conformation. For usual Normal\nModes-like calculations, make sure that the structure provided is properly\nenergy-minimized. The generated matrix can be diagonalized by gmx nmeig.\n\nThe mdrun program reads the run input file (-s) and distributes the topology\nover ranks if needed. mdrun produces at least four output files. A single log\nfile (-g) is written. The trajectory file (-o), contains coordinates,\nvelocities and optionally forces. The structure file (-c) contains the\ncoordinates and velocities of the last step. The energy file (-e) contains\nenergies, the temperature, pressure, etc, a lot of these things are also\nprinted in the log file. Optionally coordinates can be written to a compressed\ntrajectory file (-x).\n\nThe option -dhdl is only used when free energy calculation is turned on.\n\nRunning mdrun efficiently in parallel is a complex topic, many aspects of\nwhich are covered in the online User Guide. You should look there for\npractical advice on using many of the options available in mdrun.\n\nED (essential dynamics) sampling and/or additional flooding potentials are\nswitched on by using the -ei flag followed by an .edi file. The .edi file can\nbe produced with the make_edi tool or by using options in the essdyn menu of\nthe WHAT IF program. mdrun produces a .xvg output file that contains\nprojections of positions, velocities and forces onto selected eigenvectors.\n\nWhen user-defined potential functions have been selected in the .mdp file the\n-table option is used to pass mdrun a formatted table with potential\nfunctions. The file is read from either the current directory or from the\nGMXLIB directory. A number of pre-formatted tables are presented in the GMXLIB\ndir, for 6-8, 6-9, 6-10, 6-11, 6-12 Lennard-Jones potentials with normal\nCoulomb. When pair interactions are present, a separate table for pair\ninteraction functions is read using the -tablep option.\n\nWhen tabulated bonded functions are present in the topology, interaction\nfunctions are read using the -tableb option. For each different tabulated\ninteraction type used, a table file name must be given. For the topology to\nwork, a file name given here must match a character sequence before the file\nextension. That sequence is: an underscore, then a 'b' for bonds, an 'a' for\nangles or a 'd' for dihedrals, and finally the matching table number index\nused in the topology. Note that, these options are deprecated, and in future\nwill be available via grompp.\n\nThe options -px and -pf are used for writing pull COM coordinates and forces\nwhen pulling is selected in the .mdp file.\n\nThe option -membed does what used to be g_membed, i.e. embed a protein into a\nmembrane. This module requires a number of settings that are provided in a\ndata file that is the argument of this option. For more details in membrane\nembedding, see the documentation in the user guide. The options -mn and -mp\nare used to provide the index and topology files used for the embedding.\n\nThe option -pforce is useful when you suspect a simulation crashes due to too\nlarge forces. With this option coordinates and forces of atoms with a force\nlarger than a certain value will be printed to stderr. It will also terminate\nthe run when non-finite forces are present.\n\nCheckpoints containing the complete state of the system are written at regular\nintervals (option -cpt) to the file -cpo, unless option -cpt is set to -1. The\nprevious checkpoint is backed up to state_prev.cpt to make sure that a recent\nstate of the system is always available, even when the simulation is\nterminated while writing a checkpoint. With -cpnum all checkpoint files are\nkept and appended with the step number. A simulation can be continued by\nreading the full state from file with option -cpi. This option is intelligent\nin the way that if no checkpoint file is found, GROMACS just assumes a normal\nrun and starts from the first step of the .tpr file. By default the output\nwill be appending to the existing output files. The checkpoint file contains\nchecksums of all output files, such that you will never loose data when some\noutput files are modified, corrupt or removed. There are three scenarios with\n-cpi:\n\n* no files with matching names are present: new output files are written\n\n* all files are present with names and checksums matching those stored in the\ncheckpoint file: files are appended\n\n* otherwise no files are modified and a fatal error is generated\n\nWith -noappend new output files are opened and the simulation part number is\nadded to all output file names. Note that in all cases the checkpoint file\nitself is not renamed and will be overwritten, unless its name does not match\nthe -cpo option.\n\nWith checkpointing the output is appended to previously written output files,\nunless -noappend is used or none of the previous output files are present\n(except for the checkpoint file). The integrity of the files to be appended is\nverified using checksums which are stored in the checkpoint file. This ensures\nthat output can not be mixed up or corrupted due to file appending. When only\nsome of the previous output files are present, a fatal error is generated and\nno old output files are modified and no new output files are opened. The\nresult with appending will be the same as from a single run. The contents will\nbe binary identical, unless you use a different number of ranks or dynamic\nload balancing or the FFT library uses optimizations through timing.\n\nWith option -maxh a simulation is terminated and a checkpoint file is written\nat the first neighbor search step where the run time exceeds -maxh*0.99 hours.\nThis option is particularly useful in combination with setting nsteps to -1\neither in the mdp or using the similarly named command line option (although\nthe latter is deprecated). This results in an infinite run, terminated only\nwhen the time limit set by -maxh is reached (if any) or upon receiving a\nsignal.\n\nInteractive molecular dynamics (IMD) can be activated by using at least one of\nthe three IMD switches: The -imdterm switch allows one to terminate the\nsimulation from the molecular viewer (e.g. VMD). With -imdwait, mdrun pauses\nwhenever no IMD client is connected. Pulling from the IMD remote can be turned\non by -imdpull. The port mdrun listens to can be altered by -imdport.The file\npointed to by -if contains atom indices and forces if IMD pulling is used.\n\nOPTIONS\n\nOptions to specify input files:\n\n -s
